# **GifTastic**

## *Application to request Gifs / Bootcamp HW #6*

 **Giphy API key: qQ0LQq49j0vnEylR5TyfMMEiuCje5z0c**

_**How does it Work?**_

* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images using the GIPHY 
library and place them on the page. 

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
